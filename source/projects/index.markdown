neodim.hu
------------
This is my side project. The goal is to create a hn/reddit/9gag like site for hungarians. I thought that the hungarian internet lacks the depth of discussions that can be seen on hn, the variety of content like reddit. The main problem is that there are far less hungarians than english speakers.  
The site is written using the play-framework in scala and runs on a digital ocean instance. It is currently in beta. 

Galactic Winds
-----------
This will be browser based game base written in javascript like Imperium Galactica 2. Currently it is very slow so I don't really focus on it.   
You can see screenshots and the code in the repo:

Learn scala in X minutes
-----------
I started to create a small tutorial for scala for the site [http://learnxinyminutes.com/](http://learnxinyminutes.com/). In the meantime somebody already made one so I abandoned it but you can read it [in the repo](https://github.com/luos/learnscalainxminutes).
